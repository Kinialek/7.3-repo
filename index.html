<h1>Fight song</h1>
<h2>Rachel Platten</h2>
<p>Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
but I can make an explosion</p>

<p>And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time</p>

<p>This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me</p>
